       <p>Essay grading is very labor intensive, which has encouraged
         researchers and companies to build essay-grading AIs. While
         their adoption varies among classes and educational
         institutions, it’s likely that you has interacted with these
         “robo-readers’ in some way.
       </p>
       <p>The Graduate Record Exam (GRE), the primary test used for
          graduate school, grades essays using one human reader and
          one robo-reader called e-Rater. If the scores differ
          substantially, a second human reader is brought in to
          settle the discrepancy.

       <div class="uses__text--para">
       <p>A standard feature on smartphones today is voice-to-text. By
          pressing a button or saying a particular phrase (“Ok Google”,
          for example), you can start speaking and your phone converts
          the audio into text. Nowadays, this is a relatively routine
          task, but for many years, accurate automated transcription was
       </p>
       <p>beyond the abilities of even the most advanced computers.
          Google uses artificial neural networks to power voice search.
          Microsoft claims to have developed a speech-recognition system
          that can transcribe conversation slightly more accurately than humans.
