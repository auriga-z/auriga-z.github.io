Canada For orders that are placed within Canada, customers will be charged federal and provincial sales taxes – these depend on the province the order is being shipped to. Canadian orders will not be subjected to any duties, import fees, or customs fees upon delivery. United States Orders shipped to the US may be subject to duties, fees, and important taxes upon delivery if they exceed US$2500 in value. By placing an order with us, you acknowledge that this sale occurs outside the United States, and that you are importing your order for non-commercial (personal) use. You also acknowledge that you will be listed as the importer for US Customs and Border Protection purposes and that your order will be imported into the United States in accordance with the necessary customs requirements. To simplify this process, your order indicates your agreement to authorize Appareliii to appoint a designated carrier/customs broker, where applicable, as your unpaid agent for customs purposes by executing a power of attorney applicable to a single noncommercial shipment. Your order serves as an electronic signature indicating your agreement to the following, as required by US Customs and Border Protection: “The designated carrier/customs broker is hereby authorized to execute, as an unpaid agent who has knowledge of the facts, pursuant to the provisions of section 485(f), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, the consignee’s and owner’s declarations provided for in section 485 (a) and (d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and to enter on my behalf or for my account the goods described in the attached invoice which contains a true and complete statement of the facts concerning the shipment.” Your authorization permits the carrier/customs broker to file the customs entry on your behalf for any order that is over US$2500, or otherwise requires formal entry. International International orders may be subject to duties, fees, and important taxes upon delivery. Customs policies vary widely from country to country and are unfortunately beyond our control. Since duties and taxes are not included in the final price at check out, your order will be shipped DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid). As such, your order may incur duties, fees and import taxes upon delivery. This charge is determined by your local customs authority and payment of these fees is obligatory if you wish to obtain your shipment. For further information, please consult your local customs office. By placing an order with Appareliii, you acknowledge that you understand this and that you are responsible for any such charges. This charge is ultimately determined by your local customs authority. Payment of these is necessary to release your order from customs. For more information, please consult your local customs office. If you refuse to pay these charges upon delivery, your order will be returned to Appareliii and your account will be credited less any shipping and import fees associated with the return.

You agree to ensure payment for any items you may purchase from us and you acknowledge and affirm that prices are subject to change. When purchasing a physical good, you agree to provide us with a valid email and shipping address, as well as valid billing information. We reserve the right to reject or cancel an order for any reason, including errors or omissions in the information you provide to us. If we do so after payment has been processed, we will issue a refund to you in the amount of the purchase price. We may also request additional information from you prior to confirming a sale and we reserve the right to place any additional restrictions on the sale of any of our products. For the sale of physical products, we may preauthorize your credit or debit card at the time you place the order or we may simply charge your card upon shipment.
