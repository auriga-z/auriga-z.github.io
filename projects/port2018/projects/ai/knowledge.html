     <p>In artificial intelligence research, commonsense knowledge consists of facts            about the everyday world, such as "Lemons are sour", that all humans                         are expected to know. The first AI program to address common sense                          knowledge was Advice Taker in 1959 by John McCarthy

       <p>Your Amazon searches (“ironing board”, “pizza stone”, “Android charger”,                  etc.) quickly return a list of the most relevant products related to your                          search.

       <p>that its algorithms “automatically learn to combine multiple relevance                           features. Our catalog’s structured data provides us with many such                           relevance features and we learn from past search patterns and adapt to what              is important to our customers.”
